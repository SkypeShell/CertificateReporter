# CertificateReporter
Pulls certificate data with only TCP port access - no privileges required!

Inspired by (and borrowed from) Guy Bachar and Yoav Barzilay's project for Skype/Lync environments: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Lync-Certificates-Reporter-502fefaf.

CertificateReporter uses a clever technique Yoav taught me to get certificates from /any/ TCP port - including those on non-Windows servers and servers completely outside our control and network!
